# Todo List Task

This project is a simple Todo List built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```

   cd folder_name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code and creates a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

## Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

This command serves the production build from the `dist` directory.

## Linting

To run the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

This command runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite (for build tooling)
- Axios (for data fetching)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)

## Additional Information
